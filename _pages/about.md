I am a fourth year Ph.D. student under the supervision of [Dr. Subbarao Kambhampati](https://rakaposhi.eas.asu.edu/) in [Yochan Lab](https://yochan-lab.github.io/home/) at the School of Computing & AI, Arizona State University. I completed my undergraduate studies majoring in Computer Science from [Delhi Technological University](http://dtu.ac.in/), India. In the past, I have worked and collaborated with research groups at [IIIT, Delhi](http://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~arunb/) and [IIT, Madras](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~chester/) focusing on the topics of Preference-based Reinforcement Learning and Adversarial Machine Learning.  

My current research interests inlcude making AI models explainable, interpretable and secure; along with learning to incorporate human behavior and preferences. The goal of my research is to advance the field of Human-Aware Artificial Intelligence (HAAI). My primary research interests lie in developing Embodied AI agents using Reinforcement & Preference-based Learning (or RLHF) and Large Language Models (LLMs).
