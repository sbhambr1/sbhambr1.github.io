I am a fourth year Ph.D. student under the supervision of [Dr. Subbarao Kambhampati](https://rakaposhi.eas.asu.edu/) in [Yochan Lab](https://yochan-lab.github.io/home/) at the School of Computing & AI, Arizona State University. I completed my undergraduate studies majoring in Computer Science from [Delhi Technological University](http://dtu.ac.in/), India. In the past, I have worked and collaborated with research groups at [IIIT, Delhi](http://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~arunb/) and [IIT, Madras](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~chester/) focusing on the topics of Preference-based Reinforcement Learning and Adversarial Machine Learning.  

*"To live life is to take decisions, and to take decisions is to reason and plan."* 

The goal of my research is to understand, model, and develop methods for assisting humans in decision-making tasks. My PhD research focuses on understanding the advantages and limitations of Foundational Models, particularly Large Language Models from a Human-AI Interaction perspective. My current work focuses on the intersection of LLMs and Reinforcement Learning, and how these models can be used to assist humans in decision-making tasks.
